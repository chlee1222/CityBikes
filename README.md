## Reflections

As a daily user of the city bikes in Seoul, I wanted to take a deeper look into the usage around the city. 

I noticed how some areas have far more bike stations with more options and still all be taken, whereas some areas have bikes laying around for people to use. With data provided by the city of Seoul, I was able to visualize the usage of each bike station. 

After visualizing the size of every station as well as the bike paths of each station, I was curious how some geological markers encourage stations to be more popular than others. I was able to find two common traits in the more populated areas: abundance of green space and bike only roads. 

The final product was an interactive map with the option to see the bike stations, bike paths, greenspace, and bike streets- all clickable independent of each other.
